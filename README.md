# 2023_Caerang_Tensor

This repository contains the training materials and direction for the 2023 Caerang Tensor Team training program. The 2023 team will be divided into two groups to accommodate the varying skill levels of members. As a team composed of both lower and upper-level undergraduate students, some with limited knowledge of Python and others who have completed multiple projects and participated in competitions, we felt that dividing the program into beginner and intermediate levels was necessary.

#### The curriculum for the beginner level will consist of the following:

## Basic Course
Week 1: Basic Python
- Introduction to the course and objectives
- Installing and configuring Python
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and modules
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Practice and Q&A

Week 2: Advanced Python and Basic Numpy
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- File input/output
- Exception handling
- Introduction to Numpy and installation
- Numpy array creation, attributes, indexing, and slicing
- Numpy operations and functions
- Practice and Q&A

Week 3: Advanced Numpy and Basic Pandas
- Numpy array transformation, combination, and split
- Numpy broadcasting, sorting, searching, and aggregation functions
- Introduction to Pandas and installation
- Pandas Series and DataFrame creation
- Data selection, filtering, and sorting
- Practice and Q&A

Week 4: Advanced Pandas and Real-world Data Analysis
- Data combination: concat, merge, join
- Data grouping: groupby, pivot_table
- Introduction to data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, and basic examples
- Real-world data analysis project: data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
