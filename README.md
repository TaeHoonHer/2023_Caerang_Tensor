# 2023_Caerang_Tensor

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the Caerang Tensor Team's 2023 training program, encompassing a wide range of advanced concepts and practical applications in data science and analysis.

To address the diverse skill levels within our team, we have divided our program into two distinct tracks: beginner and intermediate. Our team is composed of undergraduate students ranging from freshmen to seniors, with varying levels of experience and knowledge of Python and data analysis tools. To ensure the maximum benefit and impact for all members, we have tailored our training materials to be approachable yet challenging, covering a broad range of fundamental and advanced topics.

## Beginner track curriculum includes the following topics
